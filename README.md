# WebApp-WebAPI-OpenIDConnect-DotNet-B2C

There's a newer version of this sample. Check it out: [Azure AD B2C: Call a .NET web API from a .NET web app sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2/blob/master/4-WebApp-your-API/4-2-B2C/README.md)

If you really need to access this sample, you can navigate to the master branch, but please know that it's no longer maintained.
